PROJECT 1: COVID 19 DATA ANALYSIS
Dataset:
Variables Description
continent	Continent of the geographical location
location	Geographical location
date	Date of observation
median_age	Median age of the population, UN projection for 2020
total_cases	Total confirmed cases of COVID-19. Counts can include probable cases, where reported.
new_cases 	New confirmed cases of COVID-19. Counts can include probable cases, where reported. In rare cases where our source reports a negative daily change due to a data correction, we set this metric to NA.
total_deaths	Total deaths attributed to COVID-19. Counts can include probable deaths, where reported.


PROJECT 2: BRIDGING COMMUNICATION GAP BETWEEN TEACHERS AND PARENTS
  SOLUTION: DESIGN AN APP FOR PARENTS TO STAY UPDATED ON SCHOOL NEWS , CHILDEREN'S CLASSES AND ACTIVITIES
  Analytical Goal: 
    WHY do we want to design an app and why we want to keep parents informed?: Quantity impact on student test scores
    HOW: Identify what parents want to know about
    WHY? 2 factors contributing towards it: Downward trend(data taken from 2008 -2012, scores falling from 2008 to 2022), parent involvement also dropped >10% from 2008      -2022
    Thats why parental invovement is required to improve student test scores
    HOW? Data taken from survey and dividing it in 3 groups:SPORTS, ACADEMICS, EXTRACURRICULAR
    Check the current trend for 6th ,7th and 8th Graders=> Here I found least attention is given to 8th and they are getting least news alerts.
    PRIORITIZE 8th Graders
  
 Lets design app with 3 tabs for each of the category and do test launch on parents of 8th Graders
 
 ANSWERS:
    WHY: Parental involvement correlated with higher test scores
    HOW: Creating an app with 3 gtabs for each category and doing test of version 1 of app on the parents of least involved group( which was 8th graders here)
    
 FURTHER EXPLORATION:
    Impact if multiple children are enrolled in same school
    Impact of single vs multiple caretaker

PROJECT 3: BIKE SHARING ANALYSIS TO CONVERT CASUAL RIDERS TO ANNUAL MEMMBERS FOR SPEEDY SUCCESS
  OBJECTIVE: In this case study, I am a “Jr. Data Analyst” at a company called Cyclistic, a bike sharing company based in Toronto. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Cyclistic, offers both Classic and Electrical bikes to annual members and casual riders. Members are defined as users who have annual passes. Casuals, on the other hand, refers to users who have purchased either a single day pass or a day pass.
Finance team of the company has come to conclusion that annual members are more profitable than casual riders.

  ASK: 1. How do annual members and casual riders use bikes differently?
       2. Why would casual rider turn into annual member?
       3. How to use digital media and influence them for conversion?
  
  To answer 1st question, I will prepare and process last 13 month data
